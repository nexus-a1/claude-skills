# Release Command

> Workflow: `/create-release-branch` → `/create-release` → `/merge-release` → **`/release`**

## Context

Working directory: !`pwd`

Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "(not in a git repository)"`

Latest release: !`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/resolve-latest-release.sh" 2>/dev/null || echo "(resolver unavailable)"`

Available branches: !`git branch -a --list 'master' 'main' 'release/*' 'origin/master' 'origin/main' 'origin/release/*' 2>/dev/null || echo "(no branches)"`

Recent tags: !`git for-each-ref --count=10 --sort=-v:refname --format='%(refname:short)' refs/tags 2>/dev/null || echo "(no tags)"`

Arguments provided: $ARGUMENTS

**Release terminology** — see `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/release-concepts.md`.

## Your Task

Thin dispatcher over `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/release/`. Run all steps in a single message; use parallel tool calls where independent. Do not re-derive parsing, version normalization, RC bumping, tag-existence checks, or workflow-case detection — call the scripts and surface their structured output.

The default release source is `origin/master`. Users can override by passing a branch as the second argument (e.g. `/release v1.2.0-rc.1 release/v1.2.0` for an RC off a release branch). Note: passing a `release/*` branch as the target automatically implies `--pre-release`; stable releases must target master/main. When no branch arg is given and the user appears to want something other than master, hint that they can pass one explicitly.

### Step 0 — Pre-flight: verify git repo

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null
```

If non-zero, stop with the standard "not in a git repository" message instructing the user to `cd` into a service repo.

### Step 1 — Parse arguments

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/release/parse-args.sh" \
  --skill=release-create --json -- $ARGUMENTS
```

Outcomes:
- **Exit 0** — `version` populated; `target` (branch) populated; `prerelease` may be `true`/`false`/`null`; `fasttrack` is bool.
- **Exit 10** — `missing` contains `version`. See **Resolving the version** below.
- **Exit 20** — surface errors and stop.

#### Resolving the version

When `version` is missing, suggest a concrete version. Run in parallel:

```bash
# Latest stable tag (deterministic resolver, RC-aware).
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/resolve-latest-release.sh"
# Recent tags as fallback / ladder.
git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -10
```

Then propose a bump based on conventional-commit scope using `commits-data.sh` against the resolved branch:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/release/commits-data.sh" \
  --base=<latest-tag> --head=<branch> --json
```

The JSON gives `breakdown.feat / fix / chore / …` and `has_breaking_change`. Map to a bump:

| Signal | Bump | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `has_breaking_change == true` | major | v1.2.3 → v2.0.0 |
| `breakdown.feat > 0` (no breaking) | minor | v1.2.3 → v1.3.0 |
| only `fix` / `chore` / `docs` / `refactor` | patch | v1.2.3 → v1.2.4 |

Use **AskUserQuestion** to confirm the bump (skip if `fasttrack` and the bump is unambiguous; abort fasttrack if `has_breaking_change` is true and the user did not pass an explicit version). Then re-run the parser with the chosen version.

For RC bumps (`prerelease == true`): list existing `vX.Y.Z-rc.*` tags and propose `-rc.<N+1>`.

### Step 2 — Plan: validate + detect workflow case

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/release/release-create.sh" \
  --version=<version> --branch=<branch> [--prerelease] \
  --plan --json
```

The output reports:
- `workflow_case` — one of: `none-no-release-branch`, `prerelease`, `merged`, `no-pr`, `open-pr`, `closed-not-merged`
- `release_branch` — `{name, exists}`
- `existing_pr` — non-null when a PR for `release/<version>` exists
- `apply_blocked` — non-null if apply would refuse
- `suggested_skill` — `create-release` or `merge-release` when routing is required
- `action` — what apply will run

Show a concise summary to the user. Then route based on `workflow_case`:

| `workflow_case` | What to do |
|---|---|
| `none-no-release-branch` | OK — proceed to Step 3 |
| `prerelease` | OK — proceed to Step 3 |
| `merged` | OK — proceed to Step 3 |
| `no-pr` | Use **AskUserQuestion**: "Run /create-release now?" → if yes, invoke `Skill(skill: "create-release")` then exit; otherwise stop. **Fasttrack: abort.** |
| `open-pr` | Use **AskUserQuestion**: "Run /merge-release now?" → if yes, invoke `Skill(skill: "merge-release", args: "release/<version>")` then exit; otherwise stop. **Fasttrack: abort.** |
| `closed-not-merged` | Use **AskUserQuestion** to confirm proceeding; if yes, re-plan with `--allow-unmerged-pr` for Step 4. **Fasttrack: abort.** |

### Step 3 — Author release notes

The shell library does **not** generate release-note prose. That is your job.

Gather commit data from the previous tag → release branch:

```bash
# Find the previous stable tag (or the previous RC if --prerelease).
prev_tag="$(git tag --sort=-version:refname \
            | grep -E '^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' | head -1)"
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/release/commits-data.sh" \
  --base="$prev_tag" --head=<branch> --json
```

Author a markdown release-notes file. A good shape:

```markdown
## What's Changed

<one-paragraph summary derived from breakdown — e.g. "12 commits: 4 feat, 6 fix, 1 chore. No breaking changes.">

### Features

- **api**: <subject from a feat commit> — JIRA-123
- ...

### Bug Fixes

- **ui**: <subject from a fix commit> — JIRA-456
- ...

### Other Changes

- <docs / chore / refactor commits>

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/compare/<prev-tag>...<version>
```

If `has_breaking_change == true`, surface a **⚠️ Breaking Changes** section at the top.

Write the notes to a tempfile under `.claude/session-state/` (or `/tmp/` if the workspace path isn't available):

```bash
# Use the Write tool to create the file at e.g.
#   .claude/session-state/release-notes-<version>.md
```

### Step 4 — Confirm and apply

Use **AskUserQuestion** to confirm: **Create release `<version>` from `<branch>` now?**

Skip the prompt if `fasttrack == true`; print a one-line auto-confirm marker instead.

Then record the audit gate. `gh release create` is not covered by `git-mutation-guard.sh` (the hook only matches `git push`), but this skill mutates remote state — recording the audit keeps the trail consistent with the other release skills:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/record-audit.sh"
```

Immediately followed by apply:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/release/release-create.sh" \
  --version=<version> --branch=<branch> [--prerelease] \
  --notes-file=<tempfile> [--allow-unmerged-pr] \
  --apply --json
```

If apply exits non-zero, surface stderr verbatim and stop.

### Step 5 — Report

On success:

```
✓ Release <created>
  version: <version>
  branch:  <branch>
  url:     <url>

<For pre-releases:>
⚠️  This is a pre-release and is marked as such on GitHub.
```

## Important Notes

- **Single message execution** — all steps in one assistant turn.
- **No re-derived gh/git logic in prose** — every gh/git operation goes through the shared scripts.
- **Default branch is `origin/master`** — if the user appears to want a different source (e.g. an RC off a release branch), ask them to pass it as the second argument: `/release <version> <branch>`.
- **Workflow gate** — when `release/<version>` exists, the action script enforces "no-pr → /create-release", "open-pr → /merge-release", "closed-not-merged → confirm with --allow-unmerged-pr". Do not bypass.
- **Fasttrack** (`--fasttrack | -y | --yes`) — auto-confirm the recommended version/branch/prerelease and skip the final confirmation. **Abort** (do not auto-route) if the workflow case is `no-pr`, `open-pr`, or `closed-not-merged`, or if `has_breaking_change` is true and no explicit version was supplied.
- **Notes authoring is your job** — the shell scripts deliberately don't template prose; the JSON from `commits-data.sh` is what you have to work with. Keep it factual and grouped, no marketing voice.
- **Title format** — the GitHub release title MUST be the bare version (e.g. `v1.4.0`). The script handles this; do not pass `--title` unless the user explicitly asked for a custom title.
