# Review Plan

## Context

Arguments (if provided): $ARGUMENTS

## Configuration

```bash
# Source resolve-config: marketplace installs get ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} substituted
# inline before bash runs; legacy local copies fall back to ~/.claude. If neither
# path resolves, fail loudly rather than letting resolve_artifact be undefined.
if [ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/resolve-config.sh" ]; then
  source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/resolve-config.sh"
elif [ -f "$HOME/.claude/shared/resolve-config.sh" ]; then
  source "$HOME/.claude/shared/resolve-config.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: resolve-config.sh not found — reinstall the nexus plugin: /plugin install nexus@claude-skills" >&2
  exit 1
fi
REVIEW_EXEC_MODE=$(resolve_exec_mode review_plan team)
REVIEW_PLAN_WORKFLOW_ENABLED=$(resolve_review_plan_workflow_enabled)
```

Use `$REVIEW_EXEC_MODE` to determine team vs sub-agent behavior in Step 3.
Use `$REVIEW_PLAN_WORKFLOW_ENABLED` to decide whether Step 3 attempts the orchestrated path.

## Your Task

Take an ad-hoc implementation plan, run it through design-review agents (`architect`, `quality-guard`, and optionally `security-auditor`), and return a revised plan with their adjustments applied. Fills the gap between `/brainstorm` (ideation) and `/implement` (execution) — lightweight, stateless, no requirements file needed.

---

### 1. Parse Input

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into two parts:**

- `--security` flag (anywhere in arguments) → `SECURITY_OPT_IN=1`, strip the flag
- Remaining text → `PLAN_TEXT`

**If `PLAN_TEXT` is empty after stripping flags**, use AskUserQuestion to prompt:

- header: `"Plan"`
- question: `"What plan would you like reviewed?"`
- options:
  - `"Enter plan"` / `"I'll type the plan in the text field below"`
  - `"Cancel"` / `"Never mind, don't run the review"`

If user cancels, stop with: `No plan provided. Review cancelled.`

The user's response via the text input becomes `PLAN_TEXT`. If they enter nothing twice, stop with: `Cannot review an empty plan.`

---

### 2. Decide Which Agents Run

**Always run:** `architect`, `quality-guard`

**Run `security-auditor` if any of the following:**

1. `SECURITY_OPT_IN=1` (user passed `--security`)
2. `PLAN_TEXT` matches security heuristic — check with grep, case-insensitive, for any of: `auth`, `authn`, `authz`, `authentic`, `authoriz`, `password`, `credential`, `token`, `secret`, `permission`, `role`, `session`, `cookie`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `PII`, `sensitive`, `personal data`, `payment`, `card number`, `social security`, `SSN`

Neither value goes on a command line: free text containing a quote or `$( )`
would close the argument and run. Both go to a file and are grepped as files.

**Neither value goes through a heredoc either.** A quoted delimiter disables
every expansion inside the body, which is what these two writes used to rely
on. It does not decide where the body *ends* — the body does. A plan line that
was exactly `REVIEW_PLAN_TEXT_EOF` closed the heredoc there, and every line
after it was handed to bash as source. Quoting is no defence against that: the
terminator is matched before the content is interpreted at all. The banner
above says the plan may be pasted from a ticket, a chat or a third party, and
a plan *about this skill* would carry the delimiter by accident.

An unguessable delimiter narrows that window without closing it — a model is
not a random source, and one plan can carry twenty candidate delimiter lines
for free. The `Write` tool closes the class instead: no shell parses the
content on the way in, so there is no delimiter to collide with and nothing to
quote. This is the rule in
[`kb-write-pattern.md`](../../shared/kb-write-pattern.md).

**Call 1 — prepare the directory, before any `Write`:**

```bash
umask 077
mkdir -p -m 700 "$HOME/.claude/tmp" && chmod 700 "$HOME/.claude/tmp" || exit 1
# Before the Write, not after: `Write` follows a symlink already sitting at the
# path, so a stale file or a planted link has to go first. `set -C` cannot help
# here — the write is not a shell redirection any more.
rm -f "$HOME/.claude/tmp/review-plan-args.txt" "$HOME/.claude/tmp/review-plan-text.txt"
```

The `chmod` is not redundant with `-m 700`: the mode argument applies only to a
directory `mkdir` actually creates, so an existing `~/.claude/tmp` at 755 keeps
its mode and leaves the plan world-readable. Neither name carries `$$` — the
PID differs in every Bash tool call, so a name built here would not be the name
Call 2 opens.

**Then `Write` each value to its own file** — the exact value and nothing else.
`Write` does not expand `$HOME`, so pass resolved absolute paths:

```text
Write → $HOME/.claude/tmp/review-plan-args.txt   (the raw arguments verbatim, or the single line --none-- when there were none)
Write → $HOME/.claude/tmp/review-plan-text.txt   (PLAN_TEXT verbatim)
```

`--none--` rather than an empty file, so the guard in Call 2 can tell "no
arguments were passed" from "the `Write` never happened". It is a literal this
skill chooses; it is never anything the user typed.

**Call 2 — decide the scope:**

```bash
# Both reads are guarded. The heredocs could not fail this way — the values
# were inline, so they were always there — so these guards are what close the
# regression the change would otherwise introduce: a skipped or failed `Write`
# would leave both greps reading nothing and silently drop security-auditor.
ARGS_FILE="$HOME/.claude/tmp/review-plan-args.txt"
TEXT_FILE="$HOME/.claude/tmp/review-plan-text.txt"
[ -s "$ARGS_FILE" ] || { echo "ERROR: arguments file missing or empty at $ARGS_FILE" >&2; exit 1; }
[ -s "$TEXT_FILE" ] || { echo "ERROR: plan text file missing or empty at $TEXT_FILE" >&2; exit 1; }

# The flag is still decided by grep on a FILE, never by substituting the raw
# arguments into a `case`: substituting a value in order to CHECK it is the
# same defect as using it (see shared/kb-write-pattern.md).
if grep -qF -- '--security' "$ARGS_FILE"; then
  SECURITY_OPT_IN=1
else
  SECURITY_OPT_IN=0
fi

if [ "$SECURITY_OPT_IN" = "1" ] || grep -qiE "auth(n|z|entic|oriz)|password|credential|token|secret|permission|role|session|cookie|encrypt|decrypt|pii|sensitive|personal data|payment|card number|social security|ssn" "$TEXT_FILE"; then
  INCLUDE_SECURITY=1
else
  INCLUDE_SECURITY=0
fi
rm -f "$ARGS_FILE" "$TEXT_FILE"
echo "INCLUDE_SECURITY=$INCLUDE_SECURITY"
```

`INCLUDE_SECURITY` does not survive this block either. Read the value it
printed and substitute it wherever the steps below say `INCLUDE_SECURITY=1`.

Report the decision to the user:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Review Scope
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Agents:  architect, quality-guard{, security-auditor if included}
Trigger: {--security flag | security heuristic matched on "{matched keyword}" | default scope}
Mode:    $REVIEW_EXEC_MODE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

`Mode` describes the classic path only. Step 3 decides the path after this box is printed, and
`$REVIEW_EXEC_MODE` is not consulted on the orchestrated one — omit the `Mode` line and print
`Path: orchestrated` in its place once Step 3 has taken that path, rather than showing a mode
nothing read.

---

### 3. Run Review Agents

#### Path selection

Two paths. The orchestrated one gives each reviewer the raw plan blind and puts every finding
through adversarial verification before it reaches the report; the classic one is everything
below it and remains fully supported.

**Attempt the orchestrated path when all three hold:**
- `$REVIEW_PLAN_WORKFLOW_ENABLED` is `true` (the default), and
- the `Workflow` tool is available in this session, and
- `PLAN_TEXT` is non-empty — Step 1 guarantees this, and a script cannot ask for it.

**If so, read `references/workflow-panel.md` and follow it.** It replaces the rest of Step 3 and
changes what Step 4 receives. Pass one `args` object:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `planText` | `PLAN_TEXT`, raw and verbatim — never your summary of it |
| `includeSecurity` | `true` when Step 2 resolved `INCLUDE_SECURITY=1`, otherwise `false` |
| `securityReason` | the verbatim `Trigger:` string Step 2 printed in the Review Scope box |
| `timestamp` | the current UTC timestamp |

The script has no shell and no filesystem, so anything it needs must arrive that way. That is
why the `INCLUDE_SECURITY` gate stays in Step 2's Bash block and its **result** is passed in:
the gate greps a file, and the script cannot.

`$REVIEW_EXEC_MODE` is **not** consulted on this path. A script has no teammate protocol, so
team mode's cross-pollination is a property of the classic path only — and the blind first round
is the orchestrated path's deliberate opposite trade. Say which path ran in the report either way.

**Fall back to the classic path below — silently, it is not an error — when:**
- the config disables it, or
- the `Workflow` tool is not available, or
- the orchestrated run fails or does not complete, or
- the returned `reviewIntegrity.received` is `0` (the script ran but no lens produced anything,
  so there is nothing to render).

**On a mid-run failure, discard the partial result and run the classic path in full.** Do not
merge partial orchestrated output into a classic run, and do not present a partial run as
complete.

> Detection is attempt-and-observe: nothing in the tool's contract describes how absence
> manifests, so do not write logic that depends on a specific error shape. If the orchestrated
> path does not produce a result, take the fallback.

#### Classic path

**If `$REVIEW_EXEC_MODE` = `"subagent"`:**

Run agents in parallel via a single message with multiple Task tool calls.

**Task 1 — Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "architect"`:**

```
Prompt: Validate the following ad-hoc implementation plan against architecture patterns, design soundness, and structural concerns. This is a pre-implementation design review — the plan has NOT been implemented yet.

Plan:
{PLAN_TEXT}

Evaluate:
- Does the plan respect module boundaries and separation of concerns?
- Are there architectural anti-patterns or coupling issues?
- Does the approach align with existing patterns in the codebase? (Use Explore/Grep to verify)
- Are there missing steps, hidden dependencies, or unstated prerequisites?
- Is the scope coherent — does it do one thing well, or does it sprawl?
- Are there simpler alternatives that achieve the same outcome?

Return structured findings:
- CRITICAL: architectural flaws that would require rework
- IMPORTANT: design concerns the plan should address
- SUGGESTIONS: improvements that would strengthen the plan
```

**Task 2 — Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "quality-guard"`:**

```
Prompt: Challenge the following ad-hoc implementation plan (Level 1 — Plan Validation). Be adversarial. Push back on unverified assumptions.

Plan:
{PLAN_TEXT}

Verify:
- Does the plan address the actual problem, or a tangential one?
- Which claims in the plan are assumed vs verified against the code?
- Are success criteria concrete and measurable, or vague?
- What edge cases, failure modes, or interactions is the plan silent on?
- Is the plan's scope right — too narrow (misses root cause) or too broad (scope creep)?
- What would the plan break if executed as written?

Return structured findings:
- CRITICAL: claims that appear wrong, missing pieces that would cause the plan to fail
- IMPORTANT: assumptions that need verification before proceeding
- SUGGESTIONS: gaps worth addressing even if not blocking
```

**Task 3 (only if `INCLUDE_SECURITY=1`) — Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "security-auditor"`:**

```
Prompt: Review the following ad-hoc implementation plan for security concerns. This is pre-implementation — no code exists yet.

Plan:
{PLAN_TEXT}

Evaluate:
- Does the plan introduce authentication, authorization, or session-handling changes? Are they sound?
- Input validation, output encoding, injection surfaces
- Sensitive data handling (PII, credentials, tokens)
- Secret storage, key management
- Audit logging, access trails
- OWASP-relevant concerns for the described change

Return structured findings:
- CRITICAL: security flaws that must be fixed before implementation
- IMPORTANT: security concerns the plan should address
- SUGGESTIONS: defensive improvements
```

---

**If `$REVIEW_EXEC_MODE` = `"team"` (default):**

Create a review team for cross-pollination:

```
TeamCreate(team_name="review-plan-{short_hash_of_plan}")

TaskCreate: "Validate architecture" (T1)
  description: |
    Plan: {PLAN_TEXT}
    Review for architectural soundness, pattern alignment, scope coherence.
    Share findings with teammates — quality-guard will challenge claims.

TaskCreate: "Challenge plan assumptions" (T2)
  description: |
    Plan: {PLAN_TEXT}
    Adversarial Level-1 plan validation. Verify claims, surface assumptions,
    identify gaps. Use SendMessage to challenge architect's findings or push
    back on security-auditor if their scope bleeds into design.

[If INCLUDE_SECURITY=1]
TaskCreate: "Security review" (T3)
  description: |
    Plan: {PLAN_TEXT}
    Evaluate auth, data handling, injection surfaces, secrets, logging.
    Share findings with teammates.

[PARALLEL - Single message with multiple Task calls]
Task tool: name: "arch-review", subagent_type: "architect", team_name: "review-plan-{hash}"
Task tool: name: "plan-skeptic", subagent_type: "quality-guard", team_name: "review-plan-{hash}"
[If INCLUDE_SECURITY=1]
Task tool: name: "sec-review", subagent_type: "security-auditor", team_name: "review-plan-{hash}"
```

Assign tasks. Agents cross-pollinate findings via SendMessage. Collect results and TeamDelete.

---

### 4. Render Findings Report

#### If the orchestrated path ran

You already hold a validated object — `findings`, `dropped`, `uncited`, `coverage`,
`reviewIntegrity`, `panelIntegrity`, `counts`, `verdict`. **Do not re-summarise it and do not
re-judge it.** The aggregation already happened, mechanically, where it could not be
renegotiated. Render it.

Rules that are not stylistic:

- **Report every surviving finding.** Dropping one here would undo the verification.
- **Findings with `verified: false` are labelled `[UNVERIFIED]`.** They were not judged by all
  three challengers. Reporting them as verified would claim scrutiny that did not happen.
- **Dropped findings go in their own section**, with each challenger's reason. A dropped finding
  that vanishes silently is indistinguishable from one never found.
- **Uncited findings go in their own section too**, with the reason the citation was refused.
  The script removed them, not a challenger; say so, and do not present them as review output.
  When `uncited` is non-empty the verdict is qualified — say, on the line under it, how many
  findings were refused. A run that threw everything away must not read as a clean bill.
- **When `panelIntegrity.complete` is false, say so at the top of the report**, state the
  received/dispatched counts, and mark every finding `[UNVERIFIED]`. Nothing was tallied.
- **Use the script's `verdict` verbatim, and print `verdictBasis` under it** so the reader can
  see the arithmetic. Do not recompute it and do not soften it.
- **When `verdict` is `null` there is no verdict.** Render `Verdict: not established` followed by
  `verdictBasis`. Never substitute `Plan is sound` for a missing verdict — a null verdict means
  the panel did not run, not that nothing was found.
- **When `verdictQualified` is true, say what qualifies it** on the line under the verdict: a
  lens that produced nothing (`reviewIntegrity.missing`), a survivor no challenger fully judged,
  a finding refused for its citation (`uncited`), or a severity outside the enum
  (`counts.other`). Never print the verdict bare when this flag is set — `verdictBasis` already
  carries the arithmetic and names what was not counted, so print it.
- **Name the lenses that produced nothing**, from `coverage`. Silence from a lens is not the same
  as a clean bill from it. When `includeSecurity` is false, say the security lens was not run and
  give `securityReason`.
- **Report `forgedMarkers` when non-empty.** Content that carried its own boundary marker was
  claiming a provenance it did not have; the reader should know the plan or a finding tried it.

Render into the same report shape below, mapping `critical` → 🔴 Critical, `important` →
🟡 Important, `suggestion` → 🔵 Suggestions, and attributing each finding to its `dimension`
rather than to a free-text agent name. Then continue to Step 5.

#### If the classic path ran

Combine agent outputs into a single structured report:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Plan Review — Findings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Original Plan

{PLAN_TEXT}

---

## 🔴 Critical

[Concerns that would cause the plan to fail or require rework if ignored]

- **[agent-name]** {finding}
- ...

## 🟡 Important

[Concerns the revised plan should address]

- **[agent-name]** {finding}
- ...

## 🔵 Suggestions

[Improvements worth considering]

- **[agent-name]** {finding}
- ...

{If security-auditor ran:}
## 🔒 Security

[Security-specific findings — may overlap with critical/important above, kept here for visibility]

---

## Verdict

**{One of: Plan is sound | Plan needs adjustments | Plan needs rework}**

{1-2 sentence summary of overall assessment}
```

**Verdict rubric:**
- `Plan is sound` — no critical findings, ≤ 1 important finding
- `Plan needs adjustments` — no critical findings, but multiple important findings to apply
- `Plan needs rework` — one or more critical findings

On the orchestrated path this rubric is applied by the script, over the surviving set only, and
arrives as `verdict` with its arithmetic in `verdictBasis`. It is the same rubric — the
difference is that it is computed rather than judged. Do not re-apply it by hand.

---

### 5. Produce Revised Plan

Incorporate agent feedback into a revised plan. Apply every CRITICAL finding, every IMPORTANT finding, and SUGGESTIONS where they clearly strengthen the plan without bloating scope.

Render below the findings report:

```markdown
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Revised Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

{Full revised plan — self-contained, usable as a working spec. Preserve the intent of the original plan; integrate adjustments inline rather than tacking them on at the end.}

---

### Changes from Original

- {bullet per significant change, citing the agent whose finding drove it}
- ...
```

**Save to file** — `/implement` only accepts a work directory or a requirements
file, never pasted plan text, so the revised plan must be written to disk before
handoff:

The heading is free text, so it reaches the shell through a file rather than a
command line. Substituted straight into `echo "…"`, a heading containing a quote
would close the argument and run the rest, and one containing `$( )` or
backticks would be executed outright. The delimiter is QUOTED, which is what
stops the body being expanded as it is written.

**This one keeps its heredoc, deliberately, and Step 2's two did not.** The
difference is the body, not the provenance: a *heading or first line* is
SINGLE-LINE by construction. Terminating a heredoc early needs a body line
equal to the delimiter followed by more lines to run, and a one-line body has
no line after it — the worst case is an empty slug and a
`review-plan-.md` path, not execution. That is a stronger guarantee than
provenance, and it is the same reasoning `/update-context` records for its own
single-line bindings. Step 2's plan text is a whole document and had no such
bound, which is why it moved to the `Write` tool.

```bash
# The name carries the PID so a second session in this worktree cannot overwrite
# it between the write and the read, noclobber refuses to follow a pre-planted
# symlink, and the write ABORTS if it fails — with noclobber a failed write
# leaves whatever was already there, and reading it anyway would turn a
# refused write into a silent read of someone else's content.
umask 077
mkdir -p -m 700 .claude/session-state && chmod 700 .claude/session-state
set -C
cat > ".claude/session-state/.plan-title.$$" <<'PLAN_TITLE_EOF' || exit 1
{first heading or first line of the revised plan}
PLAN_TITLE_EOF
set +C
SLUG=$(tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' < ".claude/session-state/.plan-title.$$" | tr -cs 'a-z0-9' '-' | sed 's/^-//;s/-$//' | cut -d'-' -f1-6)
rm -f ".claude/session-state/.plan-title.$$"
REVISED_PLAN_PATH=".claude/session-state/review-plan-${SLUG}.md"
```

Write the rendered Revised Plan (the markdown block above, without the
surrounding box-drawing chrome) to `$REVISED_PLAN_PATH` using the Write tool.

**Rules for the revised plan:**

- **Self-contained** — must stand alone without needing to re-read the findings
- **Preserve intent** — do not redirect the plan to a different problem, only strengthen the stated one
- **No scope creep** — if a finding suggests addressing a separate concern, note it as a follow-up rather than silently expanding scope
- **Flag unresolved concerns** — if a CRITICAL finding cannot be resolved without user input (e.g., a design choice with real trade-offs), call it out explicitly at the end instead of silently picking one

**If the verdict is `Plan needs rework`** and a critical finding requires a design decision the skill cannot make alone, use AskUserQuestion to surface the decision before producing the revised plan. Give the user the option to defer (skill emits an "unresolved" version) or pick an answer that the skill then incorporates.

This question stays here on **both** paths. A workflow script has no way to ask anything, so the
orchestrated path returns its verdict and hands the decision back to this step unchanged. Writing
the revised plan to disk stays here for the same reason: the script has no filesystem.

---

### 6. Close

Display a one-line next-step hint:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Done. Revised plan saved to: {REVISED_PLAN_PATH}
Run /nexus:implement {REVISED_PLAN_PATH}, or iterate by re-running /nexus:review-plan with the updated version.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

---

## Error Handling

- **`resolve-config.sh` missing** — handled in the Configuration block; hard-stop with install instructions.
- **Empty plan after flag stripping** — prompt via AskUserQuestion; if still empty twice, stop.
- **Agent failure (Task returns error)** — classic path: surface the error, note which agent failed, continue with the others. Only the `architect` path is strictly required; if it fails, stop with a clear error.
- **Lens failure on the orchestrated path** — a lens that dies comes back as `produced: false` in `coverage` and is named in `reviewIntegrity.missing`. Do **not** stop: report the finding set with the missing coverage stated, and treat the verdict as qualified. The one exception is `reviewIntegrity.received === 0` — no lens ran, so nothing was reviewed; fall back to the classic path in full, per Step 3.
- **Security heuristic false positive** — the opt-in decision is reported in Step 2; if the user finds it noisy, they can argue for a tighter heuristic via `/nexus:feedback`.

---

## Important Notes

- **Stateless** — no work files, no state directory, no ticket binding. Everything lives in the conversation output.
- **Pre-implementation only** — agents review the *plan*, not code. They have no implementation to inspect; findings are necessarily about design and assumptions.
- **Parallel agents** — always run in parallel; the skeptic (`quality-guard`) challenges the other agents' findings in team mode. On the orchestrated path the first round is deliberately **blind** instead — each lens reads the raw plan and nothing from another lens, so two agreeing findings are independent evidence rather than one restated — and the challenging happens afterwards, over typed findings, by three separate identities.
- **Two paths, one classic** — the orchestrated path in `references/workflow-panel.md` is additive. The prose path in Steps 3-4 is the fallback and stays fully supported; it runs in full whenever the `Workflow` tool is absent, the config disables the path, or an orchestrated run does not complete.
- **Not a substitute for `/implement` QA** — `/implement` still runs its own code-level review phase. `/nexus:review-plan` catches design problems *before* they become code.
- **Not a replacement for `/brainstorm`** — `/brainstorm` generates options; `/nexus:review-plan` validates a chosen approach. Use them in sequence if the plan is still half-formed.

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick review of a sketched plan

```bash
/nexus:review-plan Extract the auth middleware into its own package so we can share it with the admin app
```

Security-auditor auto-included (heuristic matched `auth`). Output: findings report + revised plan that likely calls out shared-state concerns, versioning of the extracted package, and test coverage gaps.

### Example 2: Explicit security opt-in on a non-obvious plan

```bash
/nexus:review-plan --security Switch our session store from in-memory to Redis so horizontal scaling works
```

Security-auditor included via flag (even though the heuristic would have matched `session` anyway). Findings will cover at-rest encryption, credential handling for the Redis connection, key rotation, and failure modes.

### Example 3: Interactive

```bash
/nexus:review-plan
```

Prompts for plan text, then proceeds.
