# Search Requirements

Search the team's requirements knowledge base for similar past work.

## Purpose

Find past implementations, architectural decisions, and lessons learned from similar features to inform current work.

## When to Use

- Before starting new feature work (research phase)
- Looking for implementation patterns to reuse
- Finding past decisions on similar problems
- Exploring team's historical knowledge

## Arguments

```bash
/search-requirements <query>
```

**query** (required): Search query
- Can be keywords (e.g., "user export excel")
- Can include filters (e.g., "tag:export component:UserService")
- Can combine multiple terms

### Search Syntax

**Keyword search:**
```bash
/search-requirements "user authentication"
```

**Tag filter:**
```bash
/search-requirements "tag:export,api"
```

**Component filter:**
```bash
/search-requirements "component:UserController"
```

**Date filter:**
```bash
/search-requirements "export after:2025-01-01"
```

**Combined:**
```bash
/search-requirements "export tag:excel component:UserService after:2025-01-01"
```

## Process

### Step 1: Check Configuration

Read project configuration:
```bash
# Source resolve-config: marketplace installs get ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} substituted
# inline before bash runs; ./install.sh users fall back to ~/.claude. If neither
# path resolves, fail loudly rather than letting resolve_artifact be undefined.
if [ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/resolve-config.sh" ]; then
  source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/shared/resolve-config.sh"
elif [ -f "$HOME/.claude/shared/resolve-config.sh" ]; then
  source "$HOME/.claude/shared/resolve-config.sh"
else
  echo "ERROR: resolve-config.sh not found. Install via marketplace or run ./install.sh" >&2
  exit 1
fi
IFS='|' read -r REPO _TYPE <<< "$(resolve_artifact_typed requirements requirements)"
_BASE="$(dirname "$REPO")"
```

If the storage location type is `git`, sync before reading:
```bash
if [[ "$_TYPE" == "git" ]]; then
  cd "$_BASE" && git pull
fi
```

Extract requirements artifact path from storage configuration.

**If not configured:**
```
Requirements storage not configured

To search past work, configure requirements storage:
1. See: ~/.claude/templates/requirements-repo/README.md
2. Add to .claude/configuration.yml:

storage:
  locations:
    team-knowledge:
      type: git
      path: /path/to/team-knowledge
  artifacts:
    requirements: { location: team-knowledge, subdir: requirements }
```

### Step 2: Delegate to Archivist

Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "archivist"`:

```
Task(archivist, "Search requirements repository

Query: ${query}
Configuration: ${requirements_config}

Tasks:
1. Sync requirements repository (if sync_command configured)
2. Parse query for keywords, filters, date ranges
3. Load index.json for fast search
4. Calculate relevance scores for matching tickets
5. Rank results by relevance (0.0-1.0)
6. Return top results with summaries

Search dimensions:
- Keyword match (title, description, requirements text)
- Tag match (if filters specified)
- Component match (if filters specified)
- Date range (if specified)

Return:
- Top 10 results ranked by relevance
- Each result: id, title, summary, relevance score, tags, components
- Total matches found
")
```

### Step 3: Display Results

**Format results:**

```

No matches found.

Suggestions:
- Try broader keywords: "export" instead of "excel export"
- Check spelling
- Try related terms: "download" instead of "export"
- Browse by tag: /search-requirements "tag:export"
- Browse recent work: /search-requirements "after:2025-01-01"

## Search Tips

### Effective Queries

**✅ Good:**
- "user export" - Broad, finds variations
- "tag:export" - Finds all export-related work
- "component:UserService" - Finds all changes to UserService
- "authentication after:2025-01-01" - Recent auth work

**❌ Less Effective:**
- "user export feature to excel with async processing" - Too specific
- "USER-123" - Use /load-requirements for specific IDs
- "how to implement export" - Use natural keywords instead

### Understanding Relevance Scores

- **0.9-1.0** ⭐ - Highly relevant, likely very similar work
- **0.7-0.9** - Relevant, useful context
- **0.5-0.7** - Somewhat relevant, may have useful patterns
- **< 0.5** - Low relevance, filtered out

### Refining Search

**Too many results?**
- Add more specific keywords
- Use tag filters: "tag:export,excel"
- Use component filters: "component:UserService"
- Narrow date range: "after:2025-06-01"

**Too few results?**
- Use broader keywords: "export" vs "excel export"
- Remove filters
- Try related terms: "download" vs "export"
- Search by technology: "tag:phpspreadsheet"
